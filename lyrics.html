        Days ache and nights are long
        Two years and still, you're not gone
        Guess I'm still holding on
        Drag my name through the dirt
        Somehow it doesn't hurt though
        Guess you're still holding on
        You told your friends you want me dead
        And said that I did everything wrong
        And you're not wrong
        
        Well, I'll take all the vitriol
        But not the thought of you moving on
        
        'Cause I'm not ready
        To find out you know how to forget me
        I'd rather hear how much you regret me
        And pray to God that you never met me
        Than forget me
        Oh, I hate to know I made you cry
        But love to know I cross your mind, babe, oh, I
        Even after all, it still wrecks me
        To find out you knew how to forget me
        Even after all this time
        
        Days ache and nights are grey
        My heart is still your place, babe
        Guess I still feel the same
        Know you can't stand my face
        Some scars you can't erase, babe
        Guess you still feel the same
        
        Well, I'll take all the vitriol
        But not the thought of you moving on
        
        'Cause I'm not ready
        To find out you know how to forget me
        I'd rather hear how much you regret me
        And pray to God that you never met me
        Than forget me
        Oh, I hate to know I made you cry
        But love to know I cross your mind, babe, oh, I
        Even after all, it still wrecks me
        To find out you knew how to forget me
        Even after all this time
        
        I'm not ready to let you forget me, 
        to let you forget me, to let you for—, oh
        I'm not ready to let you forget me, 
        to let you forget me, to let you for—, oh 
        (Even after all this time)
        I'm not ready to let you forget me, 
        to let you forget me, to let you for—, oh
        I'm not ready to let you forget me, 
        to let you forget me, to let you for—, oh
        
        'Cause I'm not ready
        To find out you know how to forget me
        I'd rather hear how much you regret me
        And pray to God that you never met me
        Than forget me
        Oh, I hate to know I made you cry
        But love to know I cross your mind, babe, oh, I
        Even after all, it still wrecks me
        To find out you knew how to forget me
        Even after all this time</pre>
